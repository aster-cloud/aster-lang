This module is test.exact.eligibility.

Define Patient with patientId: Text, age: Int, hasInsurance: Bool, insuranceType: Text, chronicConditions: Int.

Define Service with serviceCode: Text, serviceName: Text, basePrice: Int, requiresPreAuth: Bool.

Define EligibilityCheck with eligible: Bool, reason: Text, coveragePercent: Int, estimatedCost: Int, requiresPreAuth: Bool.

To determineMinorCoverage with insuranceType: Text, service: Service, produce Int:
  Return 90.

To determineSeniorCoverage with insuranceType: Text, service: Service, produce Int:
  Return 85.

To determineStandardCoverage with insuranceType: Text, service: Service, chronicConditions: Int, produce Int:
  Return 80.

To calculatePatientCost with basePrice: Int, coveragePercent: Int, produce Int:
  Let coverageAmount be *(basePrice, coveragePercent).
  Let patientPercent be -(100, coveragePercent).
  Let patientCost be *(basePrice, patientPercent).
  Return patientCost.

To checkServiceEligibility with patient: Patient, service: Service, produce EligibilityCheck:
  If not(patient.hasInsurance),:
    Return EligibilityCheck with eligible = false, reason = "No insurance coverage", coveragePercent = 0, estimatedCost = service.basePrice, requiresPreAuth = false.

  If <(patient.age, 18),:
    Let coverage be determineMinorCoverage(patient.insuranceType, service).
    Return EligibilityCheck with eligible = true, reason = "Minor coverage", coveragePercent = coverage, estimatedCost = calculatePatientCost(service.basePrice, coverage), requiresPreAuth = service.requiresPreAuth.

  If >(patient.age, 65),:
    Let coverage be determineSeniorCoverage(patient.insuranceType, service).
    Return EligibilityCheck with eligible = true, reason = "Senior coverage", coveragePercent = coverage, estimatedCost = calculatePatientCost(service.basePrice, coverage), requiresPreAuth = service.requiresPreAuth.

  Let coverage be determineStandardCoverage(patient.insuranceType, service, patient.chronicConditions).
  Return EligibilityCheck with eligible = true, reason = "Standard coverage", coveragePercent = coverage, estimatedCost = calculatePatientCost(service.basePrice, coverage), requiresPreAuth = service.requiresPreAuth.
