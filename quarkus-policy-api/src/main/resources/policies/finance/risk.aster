To assessRisk with profile: FinancialProfile, produce RiskAssessment:
  If <(profile.creditScore, 600),:

  If >(profile.monthlyExpenses, profile.monthlyIncome),:
    Return RiskAssessment with riskLevel = "HIGH", riskScore = 80, recommendation = "Cash flow concerns - require debt management plan".
  If <(profile.creditScore, 700),:
    Return RiskAssessment with riskLevel = "MEDIUM", riskScore = 50, recommendation = "Approve with higher interest rate".
